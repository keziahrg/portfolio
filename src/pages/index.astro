    <h2>Full Stack Developer Building Awesome User Experiences</h2>
    <p>
      Kia ora! I'm Keziah — a senior full stack developer with a passion for
      building sleek, user-focused experiences using React, React Native,
      TypeScript, and Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      After starting my career in Aotearoa New Zealand, I've spent the last
      three years working in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past six years, I've honed my skills at a top-tier marketing
      agency, a boutique digital studio, and most recently working in-house at a
      globally respected legal publishing platform, bringing creative ideas to
      life with clean, functional code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'm ready to take on my next adventure — <a

      > about what we can build together.

    <h2>Full Stack Developer Building Awesome User Experiences</h2>
    <p>
      Kia ora! I'm Keziah — a frontend-focused full stack developer with a
      passion for building sleek, user-focused experiences using React, React
      Native, TypeScript, and Next.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      After starting my career in Aotearoa New Zealand, I've spent the last two
      years working remotely in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past five years, I've honed my skills at a top-tier marketing
      agency and a boutique digital studio, bringing creative ideas to life with
      clean, functional code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm ready to take on my next adventure — <a
